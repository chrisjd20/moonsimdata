### What’s in this folder

Fifteen PDFs, grouped alphabetically into five chunks (e.g., `a-c`, `c-g`, `g-m`, `m-s`, `s-z`). For each chunk there are three layouts:

- characters_tarot_120x70mm_2x2_landscape_<range>.pdf
  - 4 per page (2×2), landscape US Letter
  - Exact print size per image: 120×70 mm (tarot). You can buy standard tarot sleeves for this size.

- characters_scaled_height_90mm_1x2_portrait_<range>.pdf
  - 2 per page (1×2), portrait US Letter
  - Larger print: 90 mm tall, width scaled proportionally

- characters_native_pixel_size_1up_<range>.pdf
  - 1 image per page, page size matches the image’s native pixels (no white margins)
  - Scale at print-time as you like without quality loss until you exceed the image’s native size

Filename ranges (the `<range>` suffix) indicate which character names are inside, so you can quickly open the right file for your character.

### How to print

- Paper: US Letter (8.5×11 in / 216×279 mm)
- Scaling: Use “Actual size” or 100% (turn off “Fit to page”).
- Orientation: landscape for 2×2; portrait for 1×2; either for 1-up (you can scale).
- Margins: Borderless printing is ideal; otherwise minor margins are fine (images are centered with small gutters).
