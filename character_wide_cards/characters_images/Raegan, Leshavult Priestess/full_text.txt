Expel: Whenever any character suffers a Catastrophe, after resolving 
the action, draw an Arcane card for each Catastrophe suffered. Look, 
then place it face down besides this character card. At any point you 
can add the removed card to your Arcane or Arcane Resist Hand. 
If you do then at the end of the action, or if this character is slain, 
shuffle the card back into the Arcane Deck. This character can hold 
a maximum number of cards at any time equal to the current turn 
number; if an additional card is drawn, choose a card to shuffle back 
into the Arcane Deck.
