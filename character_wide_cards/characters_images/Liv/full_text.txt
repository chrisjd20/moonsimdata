Reading the Runes: When this character activates, you may 
guess a card (colour and number, or Catastrophe) then flip an 
Arcane Card. If you guessed correctly, apply the following effect: 
X : Choose a friendly Norse model within 8" to gain 
[Protection: The first time this character would suffer Dmg, 
reduce that Dmg to W], until end of turn. 
X : Choose a model within 8" to restore X+1 Wds. 
X : Choose a model within 8" to suffer X Magical Dmg. 
Catastrophe : All models within 2" suffer 2 Magical Dmg. 
Manipulate the Runes: After resolving an Arcane action this 
model initiated but before shuffling the Arcane Deck, you may 
set aside any cards from your hand that weren't played. After 
shuffling the Arcane Deck, put any number of the set aside 
cards on the top of the deck in any order and put the remainder 
on the bottom of the deck in any order. Once per turn.
