Murder Bunny v.2
No Signature Move.
Thrall [Boris, the Bunny Summoner]: This character can only 
enter play when summoned by the named friendly character. It 
does not activate and can never gain energy. Instead, while the 
named friendly character is active, this character can take actions, 
including Jog, by discarding the required energy on the named 
friendly character. Reaction Steps and Go For It's can be taken in 
the same way.
Back in the Burrow: You can have up to 3 friendly Murder 
Bunny's in play at a time, if a fourth is summoned you must 
choose one friendly Murder Bunny to be Removed from Play. If 
Boris the Bunny Summoner is Slain or Removed from Play then 
this character is immediately considered to be Slain.
Weakling: Reduce all Melee Dmg this character deals by -1. 
Harvest actions cost this model +1 energy.
Razor Incisors: If this character plays a Rising Attack, increase 
the Dmg dealt by +2.
Hippity: You may move freely over intervening obstacles and 
models during a Jog action provided bases do not overlap at the 
end of the move.
