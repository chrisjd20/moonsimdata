Signature Move on a Rising Attack.
Woodspirit: This character may Jog over Wooded Patches. Friendly 
Treefolk within 12" ignore Wooded Patches and other friendly 
Treefolk for determining cover when using Arcane Abilities.
We are Ruwt: Each time this character would be slain, it may instead 
drop any Moonstones as if it were slain and restore half it's health 
rounding up if it can be placed within a Wooded Patch created 
earlier this game within 12". Then remove the Wooded Patch. 
New Growth: When this character uses an Arcane Ability it may 
suffer 3 Wds instead of paying the energy cost. If this reduces it to 
0 Wds the Arcane Ability is cancelled. Once per turn. 
             
Verdant Growth (2) 
X : Place a 50mm Diameter Wooded Patch within 3X" and LoS

maximum of 3 Wooded Patches may be placed by this troupe, if 
a fourth is placed you must choose and remove a Wooded Patch 
you created earlier this game.
