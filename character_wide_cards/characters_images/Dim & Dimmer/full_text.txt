Constant Bickering: When this character activates, flip 
an Arcane card. This character gains X energy, where 
X is the value on the flipped card. Catastrophe: This 
character suffers 3 Wds.
Cleaver & Club: If this character deals Impact or Slicing 
Melee Dmg, increase the Dmg dealt by +2.
Natural Padding: Reduce Impact Dmg suffered by -2. 
Two Heads are Better than One: During a round 
of Melee, after cards are drawn but before they are 
revealed, you may discard 1 energy to play 2 different 
cards. If you do, after cards are revealed you may 
choose which card is used. The other card is discarded.
